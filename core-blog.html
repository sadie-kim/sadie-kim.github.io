          <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h4>
          <br>
          At work, someone who was very trusted by the manager approached me to talk behind the manager’s back. He was I felt like the manager had to be informed about the situation, but at the same time, I knew that passing the word like that would damage my integrity. I found the situation very stressful. It was hard to know what action I needed to take in that situation. I decided to approach a friend I can trust and has more life experience. He advised that I should not pass the word as the manager probably knows already and it is best that I just bury those words in me. Now some time has passed, I am glad that I decided to reach out for help from someone more experienced when I was stuck and followed the advice. 
          <br>
          <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</h4>  
          <br>
          Perfectionism is both my strength and limitation at the same time. Because I want to do well, I work hard, but because I struggle to accept anything below perfect, I tend to neglect the timeframe given to each task and fail to meet the deadline. At the moment, I am struggling with meeting the deadline. I need to learn to apply ‘just in time’ learning as we are learning to code and acknowledge that it is impossible to have perfect knowledge when learning to code. 
          <br>
          When there is resistance or tension in a group setting at work, I try to analyse the root cause first in my head. I try to think objectively from both point of view. If there is anything I can do to improve the situation, I will try that first. If my attempt fails, I would take the matter to a manager or a facilitator.

          <h3> Learning Plan </h3>

         I currently have an open mind about where my journey will take me. 
         <br>
         My flexibility will be my strength in learning new skills. However, my flexibility makes it hard for me to stick to my initial plans. 
         <br>
         I would like to learn how to work better in team settings.
         <br>
         When I am faced with unexpected events, I will remember to approach my facilitator right away.
         <br>
         I expect the facilitation team to provide full support during the phase of bootcamp.
         <br>
         I don’t have any other commitments apart from one wedding I have to attend in February. I have already discussed this with Joseph, but will do again with my bootcamp facilitator.

          <h3> Emotional Intelligence </h3>

          <h4>
            What is Emotional Intelligence?
          </h4>
          It’s an ability to correctly recognise one’s own and other’s emotions and the ability to appropriately express and communicate emotions. 
          <h4>
            How is it different to IQ?
          </h4>
          IQ is a short for ‘Intelligence Quotient’. It is a numerical value given to measure people’s intelligence level. IQ is innate, but EQ is acquired.
          <h4>
            Why is it important?
          </h4>
          EQ is important because a huge part of working especially in most industries is working in a team with a group of people. One’s EQ can translate to someone’s ability to work well with others in a team.
