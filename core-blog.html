        <p>1)	What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?
          a)	I currently have an open mind about where my journey will take me. 
          2)	A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
          a)	My flexibility will be my strength in learning new skills. However, my flexibility makes it hard for me to stick to my initial plans. 
          3)	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          a)	I would like to learn how to work better in team settings.
          4)	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
          a)	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
          i)	I will respect the course policies.
          b)	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
          i)	It will be very important to actively try to resolve the issue before getting to that stage. However, if it does, then I will reflect on the situation, list out my options to make the situation and put the list in action. One of the first thing would be to discuss this with my facilitator.
          5)	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          a)	When I am faced with unexpected events, I will remember to approach my facilitator right away.
          6)	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
          a)	I expect the facilitation team to provide full support during the phase of bootcamp.
          7)	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
          a)	I don’t have any other commitments apart from one wedding I have to attend in February. I have already discussed this with Joseph, but will do again with my bootcamp facilitator.
          8)	These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
