          <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h4>
          <br>
          At work, someone who was very trusted by the manager approached me to talk behind the manager’s back. He was I felt like the manager had to be informed about the situation, but at the same time, I knew that passing the word like that would damage my integrity. I found the situation very stressful. It was hard to know what action I needed to take in that situation. I decided to approach a friend I can trust and has more life experience. He advised that I should not pass the word as the manager probably knows already and it is best that I just bury those words in me. Now some time has passed, I am glad that I decided to reach out for help from someone more experienced when I was stuck and followed the advice. 
          <br>
          <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</h4>  
          <br>
          Perfectionism is both my strength and limitation at the same time. Because I want to do well, I work hard, but because I struggle to accept anything below perfect, I tend to neglect the timeframe given to each task and fail to meet the deadline. At the moment, I am struggling with meeting the deadline. I need to learn to apply ‘just in time’ learning as we are learning to code and acknowledge that it is impossible to have perfect knowledge when learning to code. 
          <br>
          When there is resistance or tension in a group setting at work, I try to analyse the root cause first in my head. I try to think objectively from both point of view. If there is anything I can do to improve the situation, I will try that first. If my attempt fails, I would take the matter to a manager or a facilitator.

          <h3> Learning Plan </h3>

         I currently have an open mind about where my journey will take me. 
         <br>
         My flexibility will be my strength in learning new skills. However, my flexibility makes it hard for me to stick to my initial plans. 
         <br>
         I would like to learn how to work better in team settings.
         <br>
         When I am faced with unexpected events, I will remember to approach my facilitator right away.
         <br>
         I expect the facilitation team to provide full support during the phase of bootcamp.
         <br>
         I don’t have any other commitments apart from one wedding I have to attend in February. I have already discussed this with Joseph, but will do again with my bootcamp facilitator.

          <h3> Emotional Intelligence </h3>

          <h4>
            What is Emotional Intelligence?
          </h4>
          It’s an ability to correctly recognise one’s own and other’s emotions and the ability to appropriately express and communicate emotions. 
          <h4>
            How is it different to IQ?
          </h4>
          IQ is a short for ‘Intelligence Quotient’. It is a numerical value given to measure people’s intelligence level. IQ is innate, but EQ is acquired.
          <h4>
            Why is it important?
          </h4>
          EQ is important because a huge part of working especially in most industries is working in a team with a group of people. One’s EQ can translate to someone’s ability to work well with others in a team.

          <h3> Exploring Neuroplasticity through having a Growth Mindset </h3>
          <time datetime="2016-05-12T08:00">May 12</time>
        </header>
        <img src="img/growthmindset2.png" alt="A dogsled team in Alaska">
        <p>
          <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of our brain to continue growing when it is stimulated. Which is saying that our brain changes as we study and practice new skills.
          When people understand Neuroplasticity, they realise that they can achieve any learning goals with enough time and effort, as we have the control to change the brain as we like.  
          Applying this principle in my own learning, it tells me that my goal of learning web development is an achievable goal as long as I put my mind to it. To increase my neuroplasticity in programming, I need to code everyday even for a short period of time.
          
          <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
          Growth mindset is a viewpoint that anyone can learn anything with right learning methods based on neuroplasticity. 
          This exploration didn’t surprise me this time, as we already went though this material in pre-foundation course.
          I am going to refer to this material every time I feel overwhelmed by the bootcamp.
          
          <h4>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h4>
          The key takeaway from learning neuroblasts for me is that repetition is key. I need to set a daily routine so I can spend even a small amount of time in the things that are important to me such as coding or exercise.

          <h3> Reflecting on My Learning Journey </h3>

          <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>I can do it</li>
            <li>I need to be more self-disciplined</li>
            <li>I am not a robot</li>
          </ol>
  
        <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        Programming is working with the computer but for people and with people. So the people factor is crucial in programming. 
  
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset was very encouraging. 
  
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        I found core learnings easier than tech learnings. 
  
        <h4>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
        It is because human skills are as important as technical skills for being a great programmer. 
        
        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
        I appreciate the chance to learn about the core learning topics. The fact that Dev Academy emphasise the core skills is one of the factor that drew me to the course at Dev Academy.

          <h3> Revised Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h3>
          <time datetime="2016-05-12T08:00">May 12</time>
        </header>
        <img src="img/learningplan.png" alt="A dogsled team in Alaska">
        <p>
          <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
          I have been wanting to learn how to code for a long time because I would like to have the ability to create programs I want.

          <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
          I have tendency to leave things until the last minute, and again this trait of my hindered my progress with the bootcamp. However, once the on-site bootcamp start I will be put in an environment with other hard-working students, hence this limitation of mine won’t be a major issue. 

          <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
          I think the biggest non-technical challenge will be staying on top of the material and trying to catch up for the couple of off days I will be having due to a wedding during bootcamp. 

          <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          I would like to develop my emotional intelligence while at Dev Academy. 

          <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
          The programme is expecting a full commitment from us. I would like to expect the same from the bootcamp team as well.

          <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
          I will try to take responsibility of my own learning and reach out before too late.
