          <h4> Analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h4>
          HTML is the bone and CSS is the clothes that person is wearing.

          <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h4>
          Control flow and loops can be explained using our everyday routine. For example, wake up in the morning and go to work. Repeat until I no longer have the job. Instructions like this can be given to computer using the control flow and loops. 

          <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
          DOM is a web interface that allows us to access documents and elements so we can use them. DOM can be used to make functions work with JavaScript or add styling using CSS. 

          <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
          An array and an object are both used to store more than one values in a variable. However, array’s values can be accessed by referring to an index number. Where object’s values can be accessed by providing properties to access the stored value in an object.

          <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
          Functions are used in JavaScript to perform a particular task. When programming, often same tasks need to be repeated. When a function to perform the repeated task is defined, it simplifies the code.

          <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h4>
            <h5>Got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
              I was writing functions and it was showing error because in some places I used ‘drink’ and in some places I used ‘drinks’. I could not figure out what was wrong with my code. I didn’t think my issue would be as simple as that. I spend a long time trying to figure what the issue was and at the end I ended up sending my code to the facilitator and learnt what my issue was.
              I felt frustrated until I figured out the issue as it felt like I was stuck on a wall. The moment I realised that the issue was something very minor, I could finally relate to those programmer memes I saw on the internet. 
              Now I know to check for singular and plural in my words to look for errors next time. I feel like as I experience more of these errors, it will be easier to spot the errors as I know what to look for. 

            <h5>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h5>
             I was able to resolve a few issues myself by googling and watching YouTube videos. 

          <h4> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
            <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
              I haven’t used Pseudocoding much as I haven’t created many codes from scratch, but I will be using this technique a lot throughout the bootcamp.

            <h5>Trying something</h5>
              Trying something, aka trial and error is the technique I’ve been using a lot in my coding journey so far. I think this is a good way to learn to code.

            <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
              This is a method I already use a lot in my personal life, similar to talking to myself. 

            <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
              I have been using this since I learnt to use the DevOpsTools. This is a powerful problem-solving method as it indicates where exactly is the error. 

            <h5>Console.logging</h5>
              I have definitely been using console.log a lot as by using this I can check where the code is going. 

            <h5>Googling</h5>
              I  have been using google search to learn and resolve my issue. I feel that I have room to improve in using the google search technique. The more I learn about coding, the better words and terms I will know to find specific information quickly. 

            <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
              I did not feel comfortable doing that because I do not know other students personally yet, and I was always behind the course curriculum and the peers were already discussing the topics ahead of me. But when I was really stuck, I reached out to a few to ask for help. 

            <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
              I did not feel comfortable doing this in the beginning as the coaches seemed pretty busy. But once Joseph let me know that he is happy to help as much as I needed, I stepped up to ask for help with my progression. 

            <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
              Reflection has been very helpful as by writing down my feelings and thoughts, it helps me to understand myself better and room for improvement.
